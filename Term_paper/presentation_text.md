## Defense Q&A Preparation

**Potential Questions & Answers:**

**Q: Why ensemble over individual models?**
A: Ensemble reduces overfitting and combines linear interpretability with XGBoost's non-linear pattern recognition, achieving 89.12% accuracy vs 82-87% for individual models.

**Q: How do you handle economic volatility?**
A: Our model incorporates GDP/CPI ratios and IT export metrics that capture economic cycles. The 2020-2024 data includes COVID and war impacts, making it robust to volatility.

**Q: What about data limitations?**
A: 76 data points across 9 years provide sufficient temporal coverage. Bi-annual sampling captures seasonal trends while maintaining statistical significance.

**Q: Model generalizability?**
A: Cross-validation shows consistent performance. The model works well for Ukrainian IT market but would need retraining for other regions due to different economic contexts.
